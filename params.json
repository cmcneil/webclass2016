What is the CPU? What happens when I run a program?\r\n  + What happens when I type *www.google.com* into my browser?\r\n+ Ability to create simple webpages, and basic web technologies.\r\n  + GitHub\r\n  + HTML\r\n+ Some fun with hardware\r\n  + Controlling lights over a network.\r\n\r\n### Why These Technologies?\r\nThere are many different technologies that one could choose to teach an internet class. Here's why we choose to work with the technologies we do.\r\n#### Raspberry Pi\r\nThe [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/what-is-a-raspberry-pi/) is ideally suited to education for many reasons. It is around the price of an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction) ($30), yet it is actually a full server, running a [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) (Debian) Operating System. Therefore it can be used both to learn hardware, like an Arduino, but it also allows each student to manager their own server, which is extremely valuable to the learning process. In addition, the Pi uses SD cards for persistent memory, making it easy to have some spare SD cards on reserve, and give them to students who break their systems. In this class, we will have SD images of various system states, so we can always easily bring students who fall behind back up to speed. The Raspberry Pi is also used for projects worldwide among DIY (Do It Yourself) and Maker communities.\r\n#### Debian\r\n[Debian OS](https://www.debian.org/) is one of several Linux distributions that form the worldwide industry standard for server OSs. Debian is free, open source, and ideally suited for lightweight servers. Debian is also the best way to begin learning Linux, the primary OS used in servers, smartphones, routers, watches, etc.\r\n#### GitHub\r\nGitHub is used as a platform for code storage and collaboration worldwide. It is both useful, and a gateway to the software community.\r\n\r\n### About the Instructor\r\nCarson McNeil (@cmcneil) was awarded a Bachelor's of Science in Computation and Neural Systems (minor in Computer Science) from Caltech in 2013. \r\nHe has held his position as a Software Engineer at Google, on a Machine Learning Project for the last few years.
